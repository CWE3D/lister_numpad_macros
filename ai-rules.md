# Fine tune AI

- Do not lose focus on the task at hand
- Do not start changing code that has nothing to do with the task (except if crucial)
- Do not guess, ask if you are unsure about something
- Do not break exisiting code while fixing adding features or fixing something
- Maintain hight quality production ready code
- KISS, always KEEP IT SIMPLE (the simple solutions is king)
- Stay within the coding structure and design patterns of project with state, models, api, styling (research files if unsure)
- Never deviate from the objective without discussing it first
- If needed look at other files in the same folder to get an idea if how we do certain things
